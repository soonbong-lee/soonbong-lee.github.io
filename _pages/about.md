I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Operations at Yale School of Management, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Vahideh Manshadi](https://vahideh-manshadi.com/). My current research interests lie primarily in the design and operations of online and matching platforms, with a particular focus on nonprofit and public sector applications. Prior to joining Yale, I earned a B.B.A. and a B.S. in Applied Statistics, followed by an M.S. in Management Science from Yonsei University. During this time, I worked under the supervision of Prof. Seongmoon Kim, focusing on research related to data-driven portfolio optimization.
