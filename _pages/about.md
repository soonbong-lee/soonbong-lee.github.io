I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Operations at Yale School of Management, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Vahideh Manshadi](https://vahideh-manshadi.com/). My current research interest centers on operations for social good. I use techniques from (online) algorithm design, stochastic modeling, and game theory to design effective policies that can address unique operational challenges from nonprofit and public applications, such as refugee resettlement.
