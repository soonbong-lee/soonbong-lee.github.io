I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Operations at Yale School of Management, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Vahideh Manshadi](https://vahideh-manshadi.com/). My research interests center on **platform and policy design for social good**. Drawing tools from data science, optimization, and mathematical modeling, I design data-driven solutions and analytical methods for resource allocation and matching problems in nonprofit and public sectors to help organizations amplify their social impact. I have worked on applications in refugee resettlement, diversity policies in labor markets, and food rescue. 
Much of my work has been grounded in close collaborations with platform-based nonprofit and public organizations, including [Feeding America’s MealConnect](https://mealconnect.org/) and a national refugee resettlement agency. My research has been recognized by [several awards](https://som.yale.edu/story/2024/phd-student-soonbong-lee-wins-two-informs-awards-research-refugee-resettlement-process), including the MSOM Best Student Paper Prize, the Auctions and Market Design Rothkopf Prize, the Service Science Best Student Paper Award (finalist), and the George Nicholson Student Paper Prize (finalist).  

Prior to joining Yale, I earned a B.B.A. and a B.S. in Applied Statistics, followed by an M.S. in Management Science from Yonsei University. During this time, I worked under the supervision of Prof. Seongmoon Kim, focusing on data-driven portfolio optimization.
