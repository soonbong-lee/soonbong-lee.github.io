My hometown is [Jeju Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Island) in South Korea. 

Outside academia, I love
* playing, listening to, and even chatting about classical piano music:
  * Videos
* playing video games (who doesn't like The Last of Us?)


## Locations of key files/directories

* Basic config options: _config.yml
* Top navigation bar config: _data/navigation.yml
* Single pages: _pages/
* Collections of pages are .md or .html files in:
  * _publications/
  * _portfolio/
  * _posts/
  * _teaching/
  * _talks/
* Footer: _includes/footer.html
* Static files (like PDFs): /files/
* Profile image (can set in _config.yml): images/profile.png

## Tips and hints

* Name a file ".md" to have it render in markdown, name it ".html" to render in HTML.
* Go to the [commit list](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/commits/master) (on your repo) to find the last version Github built with Jekyll. 
  * Green check: successful build
  * Orange circle: building
  * Red X: error
  * No icon: not built
