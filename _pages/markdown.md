My hometown is [Jeju Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Island) in South Korea. 

Outside academia, I love
* playing, listening to, and even chatting about classical piano music:
  * Some of [my videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJi2V08qqFvdGjDYMPmwK2_7AWMcpT6Dq)
  * Playlist (which I constantly update): favorite [concertos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJi2V08qqFvfP7LcapiOLGJ3YhrbXWsEC) & [solo pieces](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJi2V08qqFvfvkWR15sYdbDiNHWW0LQ7t) 
* playing video games (who doesn't like [The Last of Us](https://youtu.be/R2Ebc_OFeug?si=nshG8QjnhOhqRgWe)?)


## Locations of key files/directories

## Tips and hints

* Name a file ".md" to have it render in markdown, name it ".html" to render in HTML.
* Go to the [commit list](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/commits/master) (on your repo) to find the last version Github built with Jekyll. 
  * Green check: successful build
  * Orange circle: building
  * Red X: error
